    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> ½ cup unsalted butter </li>
        <li> 1¼ cups white sugar </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
        <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour, divided </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder </li>
        <li> 1 pint fresh blueberries - rinsed, drained and patted dry </li>
        <li> ½ cup buttermilk </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>
    <ol>
       <li> In a mixing bowl combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, 
           nutmeg or cinnamon. Stir with a spoon to combine and set aside.</li>
       <li> In a larger mixing bowl combine the eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and 
           vanilla extract. Stir to combine with a spatula or beat with electric mixer 
           on low for 30 seconds.</li> 
       <li> Gradually mix in the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Using a 
           spatula, gently fold in the blueberries. The batter will be very thick!</li>
       <li> Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the batter to rest for 15 minutes. 
           During this time, preheat the oven to 425ºF.</li>
       <li> Line a muffin pan with 12 muffin liners. Fill the liners to the top with batter.
            Yes-to the top! You might think there is no way to fit all the batter in 12 
            liners, but keep dividing the batter among the cups and fill the liners FULL! 
            Use a butter knife to smooth the tops of the muffins if lumpy.</li>
       <li> Press the additional 1/2 cup of blueberries on top of the muffins and sprinkle 
           with sanding sugar. </li>
       <li> Bake for 7 minutes at 425ºF, then keeping the muffins in the oven, turn the 
           temperature down to 350ºF and bake for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted
            in the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the pan.</li>
    </ol>
