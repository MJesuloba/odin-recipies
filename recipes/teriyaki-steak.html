    <h2> Grilled Teriyaki Flank Steak </h2>

    <P>Preparing a steak teriyaki style is one of the best ways to make it delicious. This recipe uses flank steak, 
    though any steak will do. It's great to grill on a summer evening to serve with grilled vegetables or a bright 
    summer salad. Rice is a traditional accompaniment as well.</P>
    <p>The pineapple in the marinade helps to make this dish more tender and flavorful. Natural enzymes in pineapple 
        act as a meat tenderizer, perfect for this kind of steak. These enzymes are broken down by canning, so canned 
        pineapple and its juice will have a less tenderizing effect, and you can marinate the steak for up to 12 hours. 
        If you use fresh pineapple and its juice, you should marinate for no more than two hours as the meat can end up 
        mushy rather than tender.
