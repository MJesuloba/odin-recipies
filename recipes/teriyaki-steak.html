    <h2> Grilled Teriyaki Flank Steak </h2>

    <P>Preparing a steak teriyaki style is one of the best ways to make it delicious. This recipe uses flank steak, 
    though any steak will do. It's great to grill on a summer evening to serve with grilled vegetables or a bright 
    summer salad. Rice is a traditional accompaniment as well.</P>
    <p>The pineapple in the marinade helps to make this dish more tender and flavorful. Natural enzymes in pineapple 
        act as a meat tenderizer, perfect for this kind of steak. These enzymes are broken down by canning, so canned 
        pineapple and its juice will have a less tenderizing effect, and you can marinate the steak for up to 12 hours. 
        If you use fresh pineapple and its juice, you should marinate for no more than two hours as the meat can end up 
        mushy rather than tender.
    </p>


    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
       <li> 1 1/2 pounds flank steak</li>
       <h3> For the Marinade:</h3>

       <li> 1/4 cup canned pineapple, crushed</li>
       <li> 3 tablespoons pineapple juice, reserved from crushed pineapple</li>
       <li> 3 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
       <li> 2 teaspoons minced shallot</li>
       <li> 2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
       <li> 2 teaspoons cider vinegar</li>
       <li> 1 teaspoon honey</li>
       <li> 1 to 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
       <li> 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
       <li> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>3 tablespoons of crushed pineapple from can and place into a bowl. Carefully dip out 
            3 tablespoons of pineapple juice from the can. If this proves difficult to do, place 
            the remaining crushed pineapple in a strainer over a bowl. Press down with a spatula 
            to release as much liquid as you can. This should give you the necessary amount for 
            the recipe. Add remaining the marinade ingredients (soy sauce, minced shallots, olive 
            oil, cider vinegar, honey, minced garlic, minced ginger, black pepper, salt) to the 
            bowl and combine.
        </li>
        <li> Place the flank steak into a glass baking dish or plastic container and coat it on both
             sides with the marinade mixture. Cover dish tightly with plastic wrap and place into 
             refrigerator for 2 to 12 hours. Turn the steak a few times during the marinating process 
             and replace the plastic wrap over the dish each time.
        </li>
        <li> Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li> Remove the steak from the glass dish. Place the steak on the heated grill. Cook about 5 
            to 7 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the cut, until done. Remove the steaks 
            from grill once they've reached the desired doneness and let them rest for 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> Slice the flank steaks into strips across the grain.</li>
    </ol>
