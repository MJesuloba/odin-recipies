    <h2> Homemade White Bread </h2>
    <p>This fresh homemade bread is so light, soft, and fluffy. There is just something about a fresh 
        loaf of homemade bread that is magical. Itâ€™s so delicious, and one of my favorite comfort foods. 
        You just combine a few basic ingredients (hopefully you guys can find yeast in the stores right now, 
        I know there was a shortage for a while), let the dough rise, and then when the bread is baking your 
        whole house is filled with the best smell, the delicious smell of fresh bread.\

    <p> This recipe makes two loaves of fresh white bread, which is perfect because it can last for a few days 
        for everything we need it for. I love a few slices fresh and warm with butter and jam or honey, some 
        toasted up and topped with cinnamon sugar or eaten with eggs for breakfast, or slathered with peanut 
        butter and jelly or with some ham and cheese for a yummy sandwich.
