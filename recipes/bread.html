    <h2> Homemade White Bread </h2>
    <p>This fresh homemade bread is so light, soft, and fluffy. There is just something about a fresh 
        loaf of homemade bread that is magical. Itâ€™s so delicious, and one of my favorite comfort foods. 
        You just combine a few basic ingredients (hopefully you guys can find yeast in the stores right now, 
        I know there was a shortage for a while), let the dough rise, and then when the bread is baking your 
        whole house is filled with the best smell, the delicious smell of fresh bread.\
    </p>

    <p> This recipe makes two loaves of fresh white bread, which is perfect because it can last for a few days 
        for everything we need it for. I love a few slices fresh and warm with butter and jam or honey, some 
        toasted up and topped with cinnamon sugar or eaten with eggs for breakfast, or slathered with peanut 
        butter and jelly or with some ham and cheese for a yummy sandwich.

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 - .25 oz packages active dry yeast (or 4.5 tsp/ 1.5 TBS) </li>
        <li> 3 TBS white sugar </li>
        <li> 2 1/2 cups warm water </li>
        <li> 3 TBS melted butter</li>
        <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
        <li> 6 1/2 cups all purpose white flour</li>
    </ul> 

    <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>
    <ol>
       <li> In a large mixing bowl (a stand mixer is best if you have it) dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water.</li>
       <li> Add the melted butter into the mixture and stir it in.</li>
       <li> Add in the salt and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Stir till combined.</li>
       <li> Add 1/2 cup of the flour at a time, while stirring slowly, combining thoroughly
            after each addition. Until you've added 6 cups of flour total.</li>
       <li> Add more flour 1 TBS at a time as needed till the dough is pulls away from the 
           sides of the bowl. (Mine needed 6 1/4 cups total)</li>
       <li> After all flour has been added and dough pulls from the sides, knead for 8 minutes.
            (I set the kitchen aid on stir and once the dough pulled from the side I set the 
            timer for 8 minutes)</li>
       <li> Remove from bowl and oil the bowl. Place dough in bowl and roll it in oil to coat.</li>
       <li> Cover with a cloth and allow to rise for about 1 hour, till doubled.</li>
       <li> Punch the dough down to remove the air.</li>
       <li> Divide the dough into two equal halves.</li>
       <li> Roll the dough into loaves</li>
       <li> Place each loaf into a greased 9x5 bread pan.</li>
       <li> Cover and allow to rise for another 30-40 minutes, or until doubled, and dough reaches the top of the bread pan.</li>
       <li> Meanwhile preheat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
       <li> Lower temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
       <li> Remove loaves from oven, coat the tops with butter.</li>
       <li> Return to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
       <li> Remove from oven and allow to cool in pan for 10 minutes.</li>
       <li> Carefully remove from pan and allow to cool completely on a cooling rack.</li>
       <li> Slice up and serve.</li>
    </ol>
