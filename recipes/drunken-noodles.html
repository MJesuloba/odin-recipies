        <h2>Thai Drunken Noodles</h2>
        <p><em>My favorite recipe for Thai drunken noodles (pad kee mao), made with your
             choice of protein and veggies and the most irresistible Thai basil sauce.</em> 
             It's no secret that I'm obsessed with pretty much all kinds of stir-fried noodles.
              But I have to say, I think that Thailand's famous drunken noodles — pad kee mao (ผัดขี้เมา)
               — will forever be my favorites.</p>
        <p>I absolutely adore these noodles.</p>

        <p>By contrast to what their name may imply, drunken noodles aren't typically made
             with any alcohol at all. Rather, they are traditionally made with rice noodles, 
             fresh veggies, and your choice of protein (I used chicken here). But the magic 
             of this recipe lies fully in that “drunken” sauce. It's made with a blend of 
             savory, slightly-sweet, and however-spicy-you-prefer base sauce that's already 
             delicious on its own. But once it's tossed with lots and lots of anise-flavored 
             Thai holy basil, get ready, because this sauce transforms into something extra-special 
             and tastes downright irresistible.</p>

        <h3>STIR-FRY INGREDIENTS:</h3>
        <ul>
           <li> 8 ounces uncooked rice noodles</li>
           <li> 2 tablespoons oil, divided </li>
           <li> 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts*, cut into bite-sized pieces </li>
           <li> 3 scallions, chopped with white and dark green parts divided</li>
           <li> 2 cups broccoli florets (or other veggies*) </li>
           <li> 1 red bell pepper, cored and diced</li>
           <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
           <li> 1 1/2 cups tightly-packed fresh Thai basil leaves</li>
           <li> optional toppings: fresh lime wedges, sliced Thai bird chiles, 
               chopped peanuts, and/or fried garlic</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>STIR-FRY SAUCE:</h3>
        <ul>
           <li> 3 tablespooons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
           <li> 2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
           <li> 2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
           <li> 1 tablespoon sweet dark soy sauce* </li>
           <li> 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Prep the sauce: Whisk the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl
                or measuring cup until combined.</li>
           <li>Prep the noodles: Cook the noodles according to package instructions 
               until they are al dente.  Drain and rinse with cool water until the 
               noodles are no longer hot, and set aside until ready to use.  (I would
                also recommend tossing the noodles with a drizzle of oil if it will
                 be a few minutes until you add them to the stir-fry, to prevent them
                  from sticking together.)</li>
           <li>Sauté the chicken: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan or wok 
               over medium-high heat.  Season the chicken with a generous pinch of 
               salt and pepper.  Then add the chicken to the oil and sauté for 3-4 minutes,
                stirring only occasionally, until it is cooked through.  Transfer 
                the cooked chicken to a separate (clean) plate, and return the pan 
                to the heat.</li>
           <li>Cook the veggies.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan.  
               Add the white parts of the green onions and the bell pepper to the 
               pan and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the broccoli 
               and garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until 
               the veggies reach your desired level of tenderness.</li>
           <li>Combine everything.  Immediately add the cooked noodles, sauce, 
               chicken, Thai basil, and the green parts of the scallions to the 
               pan.  Give everything a good toss for 1-2 minutes until all ingredients 
               are evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
           <li>Serve warm.  Remove pan from the heat and serve immediately, garnished 
               with any of your desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
